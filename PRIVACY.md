Privacy Policy for Tab Garden
Last Updated: September 13, 2025

Thank you for using Tab Garden! This privacy policy explains how our extension handles your data. Our guiding principle is to collect the minimum data necessary to provide our features and to be fully transparent about how we use it.

1. Data Stored Locally on Your Device
   For core, offline functionality, some data is stored only on your computer using the chrome.storage API. This data is never sent to our servers unless you create an account to use social features (specifically, your productivity score).

Your List of Productive/Unproductive Websites: The lists of websites you categorize are stored locally. This is essential for the extension to determine if your current activity should contribute to your garden's growth.

Your Garden's State: Information about your plants, items, and their current status is stored locally to save your progress.

Detailed Browsing Activity: To calculate your productivity, the extension tracks time spent on websites. This detailed log of your browsing activity remains on your device and is not sent to our servers.

2. User Accounts and Social Features
   To use social features like adding friends, sending gifts, and sharing your progress, you must create a Tab Garden account. Creating an account is optional. If you choose to create one, we collect and store the following information on Google's secure Firebase servers:

Account Information:

What we store: Your email address, a chosen display name, and a unique user ID provided by Firebase Authentication.

Why we need it: To uniquely identify you, allow you to log in, manage your account (e.g., password resets), and enable you to connect with friends.

Social and Gameplay Data:

What we store: Your overall productivity score, your friends list, and data related to social interactions like friend requests, invitations, and gifts.

Why we need it: This is the core of the social experience. It allows your friends to see your score and enables you to send and receive items and requests.

3. How Your Data is Shared
   Your privacy within the social features is important. Here is what other users can and cannot see:

What Friends Can See: Users on your friends list can see your display name and your productivity score.

What Friends Cannot See: Your friends cannot see your email address, your lists of productive/unproductive websites, or your detailed browsing habits.

Finding Friends: Other users can send you a friend request by searching for your account email address. Your email is not publicly displayed.

4. Data We DO NOT Collect
   We are committed to protecting your privacy. Tab Garden DOES NOT collect, store, or transmit:

Your overall browsing history from your device to our servers.

Data from your passwords or any content you type into websites.

5. Data Deletion
   You have the right to delete your account and all associated server data at any time. To request account deletion, please contact us at the email address below. Local data stored by the extension can be cleared by removing the extension from your browser.

6. Open Source
   Tab Garden is fully open-source. We encourage you to review the code on our GitHub repository to verify that we stand by our privacy promises.

7. Changes to This Policy
   We may update this privacy policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes, and the latest version will always be available here.
