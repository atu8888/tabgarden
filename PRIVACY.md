# Privacy Policy for Tab Garden

**Last Updated:** September 10, 2025

Thank you for using Tab Garden! This privacy policy explains how our extension handles your data. Our guiding principle is to collect the minimum data necessary to provide the core features of the extension, and to be fully transparent about it.

### Data We Collect and Why

Tab Garden is designed to be a private and secure experience. All the data we "collect" is stored locally on your computer using the `chrome.storage` API. **This data is never sent to our servers or any third party.**

Here is a list of the data stored locally on your device:

1.  **Your List of Productive/Unproductive Websites:**
    * **What it is:** The list of website URLs (e.g., "youtube.com") that you categorize as either productive or unproductive.
    * **Why we need it:** This is essential for the core functionality of the extension, which is to determine if your current activity should contribute to your garden's growth.

2.  **Session and Productivity Scores:**
    * **What it is:** Data about your focus sessions, such as the duration (e.g., 45 minutes) and the resulting productivity score.
    * **Why we need it:** To show you your progress and allow you to track your focus habits over time.

3.  **Your Garden's State:**
    * **What it is:** Information about the plants in your garden and their current growth status.
    * **Why we need it:** To save your beautiful garden so it's there when you return!

### Data We Temporarily Process

To function, the extension needs to check your active tab.

* **Active Tab URL:** While a focus session is active, the extension checks the URL of your current tab to see if it matches a site on your productive list. This check happens entirely within your browser. **This browsing information is used only in real-time and is not stored or logged.** It is discarded the moment you switch tabs or end the session.

### Data We DO NOT Collect

We believe your browsing data is your own. Tab Garden **DOES NOT** collect, store, or transmit:
* Your overall browsing history.
* Any personal information (like your name, email address, or IP address).
* Data from your passwords or any content you type into websites.

### Open Source

Tab Garden is fully open-source. We encourage you to review the code on our GitHub repository to verify that we stand by our privacy promises.

### Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in this document.
